                Since William Ruto assumed the presidency, Kenya has witnessed a disturbing rise in abductions, particularly targeting government critics, activists, and individuals associated with dissenting voices. This trend has raised significant concerns among human rights organizations, citizens, and international observers alike.

                Reports indicate that the number of abductions has surged, with many victims disappearing without a trace. Families of the abducted have expressed their anguish and frustration, often feeling abandoned by the authorities. The victims often include journalists, political opponents, and social activists who voice dissent against the government.

                In response to these incidents, the Ruto administration has denied any involvement in the abductions. Officials have claimed that the government is committed to upholding human rights and ensuring the safety of all citizens. However, many remain skeptical of these assurances, citing the lack of concrete actions to address the ongoing crisis.

                Human rights groups have been vocal in condemning the rise in abductions. Organizations like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have called on the Kenyan government to conduct thorough investigations into the disappearances and ensure accountability for those responsible. They emphasize the need for protective measures for individuals at risk of abduction.

                The increasing fear of abduction has created a chilling effect within society. Many individuals are hesitant to express their opinions publicly or engage in political discourse, fearing for their safety. This atmosphere of fear undermines democracy and stifles free speech, which are essential components of a healthy society.
